\usage{
PlotLoadSpec(
  model,
  PC = 1,
  roi = c(0.5, 9.5),
  type = "Backscaled",
  X = NULL,
  ppm = NULL,
  Median = FALSE,
  optns = list()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{are the output from : PCA(), prcomp(), oplsda() or ropls::opls()}

\item{PC}{numeric, the component that you want to plot the loadings of
Default is 1 and only require to change when plotting PCA or PLS model}

\item{roi}{numeric, the region of interest (default is from 0.5 to 9.5 ppm)}

\item{type}{character specifying the loading visualization type
"Statistical reconstruction" calculate the covariance for the trace
(y) and Pearson's correlation of the predictive (O)PLS scores with
each ppm for the color.//
"Backscaling" calculate the trace with predicted loadings multiplied
by the standard deviation of X feature, color is the minmax-normalised
absolute value of the loading.//
for PCA it is always "Statistical reconstruction".
but for PLS and OPLS "Backscaling" method is recommended.}

\item{X}{spectral data matrix used for the model.
This is needed for PCA with prcomp package, or
(O)PLS with type = "Statistical reconstruction".}

\item{ppm}{chemical shift scale. If NULL (default), it is read from the row names
of the loading matrix. If the rows are unnamed, row indices are
used instead with a warning.}

\item{Median}{only works for OPLS-DA model using mva.plot().
Default is FALSE.
When Median = True
Median spectra of each groups will be added on the top of loading plot showing the same direction as score plot}

\item{optns}{list, additional options (not implemented yet)}
}
\value{
plot of the loadings
}
\description{
Allow to plot loadings of PCA, PLS, OPLS,PLS-DA and OPLS-DA
}
